# Imaging
Project intended to allow user to take a picture of a comic or drawing (within reasonable lighting) and eventually create a digital image of it using a threshold ask/response as well as getting rid of "fuzz" or eraser marks. Simple design using Python coding/ PIL, may switch to Pillow if integration is simple. 
# Disclaimer
Current program is not functioning as intended. New source code will be available soon. For more information, contact mmmezher directly.
